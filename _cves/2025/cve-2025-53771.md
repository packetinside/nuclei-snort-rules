severity: "medium"
impact: "Unauthenticated attackers can bypass SharePoint authentication controls by spoofing the Referer header, gaining unauthorized access to protected administrative endpoints. When combined with CVE-2025-53770, this leads to full remote code execution and system compromise.
"
remediation: "Apply the latest security patches from Microsoft released on July 21, 2025. Additionally, rotate ASP.NET MachineKey values (ValidationKey and DecryptionKey) on all SharePoint servers using Set-SPMachineKey or Update-SPMachineKey, then restart IIS.

## 🔍 Vulnerability Description
Microsoft Office SharePoint Server contains an improper authentication vulnerability that allows unauthorized attackers to perform spoofing over a network. By crafting a POST request to /_layouts/15/ToolPane.aspx with a forged Referer header (/_layouts/SignOut.aspx), attackers can bypass authentication mechanisms and gain unauthorized access to protected endpoints. This vulnerability is part of the ToolShell exploit chain and is a patch bypass for CVE-2025-49706. When chained with CVE-2025-53770 (deserialization vulnerability), it enables unauthenticated remote code execution on SharePoint Server.
